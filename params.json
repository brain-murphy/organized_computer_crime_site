These groups are as diverse in structure as they are in origin -- very diverse, that is. The stereotype of the lone hacker is quickly vanishing; although solo hackers still do significant damage to computer infrastructure worldwide, the ecosystem of cyber crime is becoming increasingly dominated by bigger players: organizations, collectives, and governments. \r\n\r\nDespite the increasing sophistication of attackers, attack motivations are mostly the same as they have always been: economical, ideological, and political. Attackers and victims reside all around the globe; there are very few innocent parties, and almost no nations are unaffected by the digital war that is constantly, though subtly raging.\r\n\r\n## Criminal Organizations\r\nThe standard definition of organized crime coming from the UN Palermo Convention states that it involves a conspiracy of three or more people. Unfortunately, that is one of the few things that can be generalized to encompass all computer crime organizations. The idea of organized crime with which people are the most familiar is that of a criminal hierarchy -- a \"crime family\". Increasingly, cyber criminals are far less centralized, using anonymity over familiarity as the currency of trust. Some researchers have labeled these new, decentralized structures \"swarms\" and \"hubs\". However, just as nearly all modern businesses have established a web presence, traditional criminal organizations, too, are moving online. As this process continues, the distinction between an online and an offline criminal organization will, doubtless, blur.\r\n\r\n### Swarms\r\nA traditional criminal organization is easy to conceptualize; it has all of the familiar structures of a government or business: they exhibit executive members, bureaucracies , divisions, and field workers. These traditional groups are founded discretely, and only take overt action once they have enough influence to so without repercussions. An offline group can maintain this model by keeping communications private, only doing business with people who can be trusted, and by punishing those who are disloyal. The internet, however, has no back rooms. A criminal on the internet has no one to trust, and, by extension, no resources for discretion. Consider a cyber criminal searching for someone to whom to sell his stolen information. He cannot simply auction it off on Ebay; he would be immediately traceable by law enforcement agencies. He cannot trust anyone who solicits him for his goods either; law enforcement officials constantly try to infiltrate criminal activity on the internet. The only asset that allows the cyber criminal to distribute and purchase goods is his or her anonymity. \r\n\r\nThe internet criminal can trust that his customer will not reveal his identity because, quite plainly, his customer will never know his identity. Even collaboration with other cyber criminals can be secured through the veil of anonymity. The type of computer crime organization known as a swarm evolved directly from the use of anonymity among groups of criminals. Appropriately enough, the hacker group \"Anonymous\" exhibits these qualities. The group has no central leadership. They are a network of individuals with similar goals. They can communicate in order to attack with the force of an organization, but each member operates out of his or her own will, with no orders coming down from a leadership nucleus.\r\n\r\n### Hubs\r\nSome digital criminal activity gains some semblance of centralization when criminals congregate around a hub. A hub almost always consists of a website that facilitates criminal activity on the internet. Often, these sites are simple marketplaces for illicit goods. Websites dealing in illegal drugs, illegal porn, and credit card numbers are common and prosperous. In other cases, a hub might organize its users into a more sophisticated attack force. For example, the Russian-founded DrinkOrDie created a specialized operation that was able to distribute pirated media, including games, movies and music. Their operation consisted of many different jobs, including \"crackers\", \"testers\", and \"packers\". The group had a well defined, rotating leadership, and was able to large profits for its members. However, this centrality eventually led to the demise of DrinkOrDie, as one member revealed the identities of other members when given a bargain by the authorities. Many criminals make use of hubs while maintaining a barrier of anonymity, in order to keep themselves abreast of the catastrophic downfalls for which all criminal organizations seem historically destined.\r\n\r\n## Governments\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
