These groups are as diverse in structure as they are in origin -- very diverse, that is. The stereotype of the lone hacker is quickly vanishing; although solo hackers still do significant damage to computer infrastructure worldwide, the ecosystem of cyber crime is becoming increasingly dominated by bigger players: organizations, collectives, and governments. \r\n\r\nDespite the increasing sophistication of attackers, attack motivations are mostly the same as they have always been: economical, ideological, and political. Attackers and victims reside all around the globe; there are very few innocent parties, and almost no nations are unaffected by the digital war that is constantly, though subtly raging.\r\n\r\n## Criminal Organizations\r\nThe standard definition of organized crime coming from the UN Palermo Convention states that it involves a conspiracy of three or more people. Unfortunately, that is one of the few things that can be generalized to encompass all computer crime organizations. The idea of organized crime with which people are the most familiar is that of a criminal hierarchy -- a \"crime family\". Increasingly, cyber criminals are far less centralized, using anonymity over familiarity as the currency of trust. Some researchers have labeled these new, decentralized structures \"swarms\" and \"hubs\". However, just as nearly all modern businesses have established a web presence, traditional criminal organizations, too, are moving online. As this process continues, the distinction between an online and an offline criminal organization will, doubtless, blur.\r\n\r\n### Swarms\r\nA traditional criminal organization is easy to conceptualize; it has all of the familiar structures of a government or business: they exhibit executive members, bureaucracies , divisions, and field workers. These traditional groups are founded discretely, and only take overt action once they have enough influence to so without repercussions. An offline group can maintain this model by keeping communications private, only doing business with people who can be trusted, and by punishing those who are disloyal. The internet, however, has no back rooms. A criminal on the internet has no one to trust, and, by extension, no resources for discretion. Consider a cyber criminal searching for someone to whom to sell his stolen information. He cannot simply auction it off on Ebay; he would be immediately traceable by law enforcement agencies. He cannot trust anyone who solicits him for his goods either; law enforcement officials constantly try to infiltrate criminal activity on the internet. The only asset that allows the cyber criminal to distribute and purchase goods is his or her anonymity. \r\n\r\nThe internet criminal can trust that his customer will not reveal his identity because, quite plainly, his customer will never know his identity. Even collaboration with other cyber criminals can be secured through the veil of anonymity. The type of computer crime organization known as a swarm evolved directly from the use of anonymity among groups of criminals. Appropriately enough, the hacker group \"Anonymous\" exhibits these qualities. The group has no central leadership. They are a network of individuals with similar goals. They can communicate in order to attack with the force of an organization, but each member operates out of his or her own will, with no orders coming down from a leadership nucleus.\r\n\r\n### Hubs\r\nSome digital criminal activity gains some semblance of centralization when criminals congregate around a hub. A hub almost always consists of a website that facilitates criminal activity on the internet. Often, these sites are simple marketplaces for illicit goods. Websites dealing in illegal drugs, illegal porn, and credit card numbers are common and prosperous. In other cases, a hub might organize its users into a more sophisticated attack force. For example, the Russian-founded DrinkOrDie created a specialized operation that was able to distribute pirated media, including games, movies and music. Their operation consisted of many different jobs, including \"crackers\", \"testers\", and \"packers\". The group had a well defined, rotating leadership, and was able to large profits for its members. However, this centrality eventually led to the demise of DrinkOrDie, as one member revealed the identities of other members when given a bargain by the authorities. Many criminals make use of hubs while maintaining a barrier of anonymity, in order to keep themselves abreast of the catastrophic downfalls for which all criminal organizations seem historically destined.\r\n\r\n## State Sponsored Cyber Crime\r\nAlthough governments may foster different motivations than other perpetrators of computer crime, they have earned the label of cyber crime organizations by enacting some of the most sophisticated and numerous attacks to date. Governments all over the world leverage their resources and intelligence to project their power at military as well as civilian targets. Because the internet has no conventional borders, and cyber warfare no front lines, all of the world's businesses and infrastructure are left to defend against armies of state-sponsored hackers, alone.\r\n\r\n### China \r\nThe People's Republic of China has rapidly become the most apparent threat in computer security (as they have with most things they do). They have earned this designation in part because of the damage that they have been able to inflict upon businesses and governments alike, but also because of the sheer volume of the attacks they produce. Chinese attacks are characterized by large volumes of unsophisticated exploit attempts. Like their military, Chinese cyber warfare divisions achieve success by employing overwhelming numbers of under equipped foot soldiers. Chinese attackers employ brute-force methods and do little to cover their tracks. \r\n\r\nBecause China does little to stop cyber-criminals that operate in China, it is often difficult for professionals to distinguish between a state sponsored attack and the work of a criminal syndicate. This also works to China's advantage, as it offers a degree of plausible deniability for state-sponsored attacks against private financial entities. As is common in China, the lines between government and public activity often blur. Many security researchers believe that the Chinese hacker group \"Comment Crew\" is a contractor to the Chinese government. This group was responsible for attacks on several US aerospace companies.\r\n\r\n### Russia\r\nRussia usually appears suspiciously inactive in the cyber-warfare space. However, in full perspective of the situation, Russia is likely one of the most technically advanced entities in state-sponsored computer crime. When Russian hacks are identified, they exhibit high levels of technical prowess and implement advanced methods of evading detection and attribution. There is also evidence to suggest that Russian hackers have used \"false-flag\" methods of evading attribution, in that they posed as Chinese attackers. Lack of evidence never makes for very strong evidence, but in this case the possibility that Russian attackers are some of the most dangerous in the world isn't belied by the facts.\r\n\r\n### United States of America\r\nThe US has a reputation of producing some of the most sophisticated and well planned exploits in the world, thanks to its bountiful human and monetary resources. US attacks are typically very targeted, compromising as few computers as possible, rather than as many as possible. US exploit code is typically authored by huge teams, revolving around a specific target of national interest. The Stuxnet attack, in which the US is implicated, managed to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges from across the world. Most US cyber crime likely revolves around surveillance, but, like Russian activities, most of what we know likely comes from the small percentage of attacks that have been discovered, while many illicit activities could still be still perpetrated without public knowledge. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
