These groups are as diverse in structure as they are in origin -- very diverse, that is. The stereotype of the lone hacker is quickly vanishing; although solo hackers still do significant damage to computer infrastructure worldwide, the ecosystem of cyber crime is becoming increasingly dominated by bigger players: organizations, collectives, and governments. \r\n\r\nDespite the increasing sophistication of attackers, attack motivations are mostly the same as they have always been: economical, ideological, and political. Attackers and victims reside all around the globe; there are very few innocent parties, and almost no nations are unaffected by the digital war that is constantly, though subtly raging.\r\n\r\n## Criminal Organizations\r\nThe standard definition of organized crime coming from the UN Palermo Convention states that it involves a conspiracy of three or more people. Unfortunately, that is one of the few things that can be generalized to encompass all computer crime organizations. The idea of organized crime with which people are the most familiar is that of a criminal hierarchy -- a \"crime family\". Increasingly, cyber criminals are far less centralized, using anonymity over familiarity as the currency of trust. However, just as nearly all modern businesses have established a web presence, traditional criminal organizations, too, are moving online. As this process continues, the distinction between an online and an offline criminal organization will, doubtless, blur.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
